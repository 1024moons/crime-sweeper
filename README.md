# crime-sweeper
Probability based Minesweeper solver.

Many details uncertain now. But I want to take an honest crack at the problem without doing any external research beforehand.
I have a general idea on how I want it done (hence the probability part) but I don't really know how the final product will
actually function.
That means it will be probably very bad. Then I may take a looksie-loo at other solutions after I'm satisfied and bring improvements to this
solver, but doing it now would be putting the cart before the horse.
